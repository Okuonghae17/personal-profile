        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> As a university student with a burning enthusiasm for web development, I'm determined to carve my path in the
            tech industry. My journey began with certification as a website developer, and I'm on the way to becoming a well
           rounded full-stack developer.</p>
        <p> While I'm still studying and building my skills, I am proud to have represented my school at a seminar in the UK,
            where I gained valuable insights into the global tech landscape. My certification from FreeCodeCamp reflects my
            commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement.</p>
        <p>I'm a hardworking and punctual individual who embraces challenges with open arms. Although my backend
            development skills are a work in progress, I'm excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in this aspect.
            Outside of my academic pursuits, I find solace in music; I enjoy singing and playing the guitar. These creative
            interests complement my technical endeavors and provide a unique glimpse into my personality.</p>
        <p>As I continue my studies and work to strengthen my backend development skills, I'm actively exploring
            opportunities that will allow me to apply my knowledge and gain practical experience. I'm eager to connect with
            industry professionals, mentors, and peers who can guide me on my journey and help me make a meaningful
            impact in the web development world.
            I am currently certified in HTML5 and CSS3 and I have Built various projects with this</p>
